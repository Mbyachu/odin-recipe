        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a bowl, combine ground beef, chopped onion, minced garlic,
                Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
            </li>
            <li>Form the mixture into 4 equal-sized patties.</li>
            <li>
                Preheat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the
                patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they reach
                your desired level of doneness.
            </li>
            <li>Toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster.</li>
            <li>
                Assemble the burgers by placing the cooked patties on the buns
                and adding lettuce, tomato, cheese, and your favorite
                condiments.
            </li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
